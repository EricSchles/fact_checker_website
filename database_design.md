There are a number of ideas that need to be modeled as data:

Skills
	* Languages
	* Types of Work, E.G. Machine Learning, SRE, deployments, Database design, Data Visualization, SQL
	* Job Title
	* Skills desired to learn
	* Skills desired to teach
	* Projects worked on

Interpersonal relationships
	* Projects worked on
	* People mentored
	* Mentored by
	* Facilitator
	* Facilitation group
	* guild affiliated
	* working group affiliated

This needs to be done via an ontological structure.  Therefore a graph database will be needed.
