# fact_checker_website

The fact checker website will be a portal for fact checkers to get urls to fact check.  

The work flow:

The fact checker signs into the website.  
They are presented with a url (or possibly set of urls)
They click on one of the urls.
They are then redirected to the website.
They read the url providing notes and feedback as to whether the article is 
factual and if there are inaccuracies, what those inaccuracies are.
