## Problem set up

There were three fundamental failures during the election of 2016 which are motivated by the following premise:

"
	The defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are WEAK while partisanship is STRONG.
"
-Julia Azari
	
Historically there have been 3 areas that stopped demogaugs from getting power:
	
	1. Money - large donors would signal which candidates to back by the size of their donations.
	2. The press - the press would signal which candidates to pay attention to and take seriously, 
	by giving coverage to candidates that matter.
	3. The parties - the parties would signal which candidates to take seriously with their endorsements.

Trump managed to circumvent all three of these safeguards:

Money, by being a campaign contributor for years - he knew many of the big donors, by being one for years.  This meant he could circumvent this system, mostly by "self funding" his primary.

The press - the press gave him a lot of free coverage - this is primarily due to how much money he made them.  It became "must see" TV.  

The parties - political parties are weak and partisanship is strong - if parties don't back their candidates they risk losing re-election and thus losing their own jobs.  So despite the strong misgivings many major republicans stated regarding trump, they endorsed him.  Because they had or would likely lose their jobs.

#So given that these institutions all failed us?  Where do we go from here?
