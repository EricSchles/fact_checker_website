## Problem set up

There were three fundamental failures during the election of 2016 which are motivated by the following premise:

"
	The defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are WEAK while partisanship is STRONG.
"
-Julia Azari
	
Historically there have been 3 areas that stopped demogaugs from getting power:
	
	1. Money - large donors would signal which candidates to back by the size of their donations.
	2. The press - the press would signal which candidates to pay attention to and take seriously, 
	by giving coverage to candidates that matter.
	3. The parties - the parties would signal which candidates to take seriously with their endorsements.

Trump managed to circumvent all three of these safeguards:

Money, by being a campaign contributor for years - he knew many of the big donors, by being one for years.  This meant he could circumvent this system, mostly by "self funding" his primary.

The press - the press gave him a lot of free coverage - this is primarily due to how much money he made them.  It became "must see" TV.  

The parties - political parties are weak and partisanship is strong - if parties don't back their candidates they risk losing re-election and thus losing their own jobs.  So despite the strong misgivings many major republicans stated regarding trump, they endorsed him.  Because they had or would likely lose their jobs.

"
	The defining characteristic of our moment is that parties are WEAK while partisanship is STRONG.
"
-Julia Azari

Right now partisanship is at one of it's highest points ever - Currently approximately 77% of democrats and republicans are unwilling to back a candidate from the other side, simply because of which party they are affiliated with.

This comes down to a question of trust - So why is there a lack of trust?

Because of fake, highly partisan "news" (it's really propaganda) and because a lot of people are experiencing a lower standard of living than their parents for the first time.

## The start of a solution

We as a nation are going to need to be more discerning of the media we consume, about the articles we reference, and about how understand the world around us.

My idea is creating a platform that gives people the tools to assess the quality of the news they consume - teaching individuals the skill of critical reading.  A skill that we as a society have clearly lost.

This solution exists in three parts:

* Collection of news stories from social media - scraping facebook and twitter
* A fact checker website where people can learn to fact check articles
* An ongoing analysis of the fake, partisan news in our society - with metrics checking how much there is and how fast it spreads.
